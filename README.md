#Popular Movies - II
###Popular Movies App
This is an android app which I made from scratch for Android Nanodegree Developer course. This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices. This app also has additional features which were not the requirement for Nanodegree program. 

##Features

    * Accessible even when offline.

### How to use the source
This app uses [TheMovieDbOrg](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API KEY in order to build the app.
